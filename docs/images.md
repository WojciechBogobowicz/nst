# Images
Images folder contains two types of subfolders:  

- **Input** subfolders - `contents` and `styles` folders where content and style images prepared for training are stored.  
- **Output** subfolders - are folders prepared for [`save_vizualizations()`][src.vizualization.save_vizualizations] function output. This function saves two images. First of them is an image generated by NSTImageTrainer and it is saved in `results` subfolder. Second is NSTImageTrainer summary schema generated by [`plot_trainer()`][src.vizualization.plot_trainer] function. It is saved in `trainers` subfolder.
