# Neural Style Trainsfer Project

## Project description

The goal of this project was to create neural style transfer (NST) model, that allows user to create unique and cool graphics without ability to draw ;\) by transfering style of one image to another.  
Details how NST work, can be found in this [paper](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf). This project was also inspired by this [tensorflow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/style_transfer?hl=pl) and [Andrew Ng CNN course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks).
